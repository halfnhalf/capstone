Once you leave this screen and press start, the hearing test will begin.

The hearing test will be taken in individual ears starting with the left ear 
and will cover a range of frequencies. (During the short test only one 
frequency will be covered)

If you would like to stop the test at any time press the stop test button.

Follow these steps to take your hearing test:
1.  A tone will be played on one ear with incremental volumes starting 
     at near silence - gradually getting louder. You will also hear a masking 
     noise on the opposite ear.
2.  When you're able to hear the tone, press the "I hear it!" button.
3.  If some hearing loss is detected then the bone transducer test will 
     also be conducted. This follows the same procedure as the air conduction test.

After the test has been completed your results will be shown. 

NOTE: Leaving the test page will end the procedure.
